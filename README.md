Project Description

Auto Planner MIRO is a desktop application (WinForms) created as a proof-of-concept for automatic planning and visualization of warehouse order preparation.
The tool simulates allocation of orders to formeren stations (workstations) and ready locations (docks), with live output to a MIRO board through the MIRO API.
Order categories, colors, and time parameters are hardcoded in the application, while user-supplied CSV files are used for additional constraints.

Key Features

Dynamic planning with constraints

Order priorities (priority list from CSV)

Time windows (loading/start/end in minutes)

Operator and workstation availability

Blocking docks at specific times (from CSV)

Validation rules (minimum two docks per operator)

Priority & severity handling

Priority orders can override standard allocation rules

Severity levels influence visualization and allocation

Error handling when constraints cannot be respected

CSV-based configuration (limited scope)

priority_orders.csv → defines priority orders

docks.csv → defines blocked docks and times

MIRO API integration

Creates shapes on a MIRO board for each order

Colors/shapes depend on category and severity

Uses RestSharp for communication with MIRO

User Interface (WinForms)

Wizard for choosing:

number of stations

number of ready locations

layout type (H/K)

Console-like logging panel (“Terminal”)

Technologies

C# / .NET (WinForms)

RestSharp (HTTP calls to MIRO API)

Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (appsettings.json support)

CSV input (priority orders, dock blocking)

MIRO API

Installation & Setup

Download or clone the repository.

Prepare the CSV files if needed:

priority_orders.csv – leave only header row if you want to disable priorities.

docks.csv – optional, defines blocked docks and times.

Update appsettings.json with:

MIRO API key

MIRO board ID

Application parameters (colors, layout settings – if used).

Make sure you have the required version of .NET Framework installed.

Run the application.

Usage Notes

⚠️ Each operator must have at least 2 docks available.
Do not block docks in a way that leaves fewer than 2 open – this will cause assignment errors.

⚠️ Too many priority orders may break planning.
The algorithm assumes priority orders are rare and exceptional.

⚠️ To disable priority orders:
Clear all rows (except the header) in priority_orders.csv.
